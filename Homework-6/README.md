b)GOAL:  * acquire LDR resistance value every ms and to send its average value to a
  * remote terminal every 1s. Convert the resistance value to a lux level and
  * send that to the remote terminal.


b) GOAL:
  * Acquire 3 voltages (potentiometer, temperature sensor, Vref)
  * every 1 s and to send them to a remote terminal.
  * The acquisition are started via hardware by a timer
  * and data are saved in the microcontroller memory using DMA.
