# Sensor System Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded firmware projects developed for the **Sensor Systems** course at **Politecnico di Milano**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} The course focuses on interfacing sensors, signal acquisition, and embedded system design using STM32 microcontrollers.

This repository represents a group project for the Sensor Systems course. While all commits are under my GitHub account, the work was a collaborative effort among all group members. The commit history does not reflect the individual contributions accurately.

## Project Overview

The projects are organized by homework assignments, each targeting specific aspects of embedded systems:

- **Homework 2**: External interrupts and PWM basics.
- **Homework 3**: Audio playback using PWM with and without `HAL_Delay`.
- **Homework 4**: UART communication via DMA and LCD display handling.
- **Homework 5**: UART reception, ADC acquisition, and LCD display updates.
- **Homework 6**: Sensor data acquisition with timer-triggered ADC and UART transmission.
- **Homework 7**: Temperature reading via I2C and periodic UART transmission.
- **Homework 8**: Accelerometer data acquisition and UART transmission.
- **Homework 9**: LED matrix control via SPI and timer interrupts.
- **Homework 10**: Keypad scanning with UART transmission and encoder RPM measurement.
- **Homework 11**: UART communication over infrared using PWM.

## Hardware Platform

The projects are designed to run on a custom STM32-based microcontroller board with integrated peripherals, provided by the course instructors. A "Peripherals.md` file is included in the repository, detailing the pin assignments and connected peripherals.
