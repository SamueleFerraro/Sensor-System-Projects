# Homework 5 â€“ UART Reception and ADC Acquisition

- **Part a**: Receives a variable-length string from the PC via UART (DMA) and displays it on the LCD.  
- **Part b**: Samples potentiometer voltage at 1 Hz (timer-triggered ADC) and sends the value to the PC via UART.  
- **Part c**: Same as Part b, but displays the sampled voltage on the LCD instead of sending it.
